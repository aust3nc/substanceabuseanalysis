# Overview

To solidify concepts I've been learning about in data analysis, I sought out an issue that I found interesting: drug addiction and abuse. I wanted to ask a couple of questions concerning the issue. First, what is the most prevalent substance abused today? Second, what is the age group most affected by drug abuse?

To ask these questions, I found a free dataset outlining drug abuse by age and drug type.

# Data Analysis Results

Questions I asked:

1) What is the most prevalent substance abused today?
2) What age group is most at risk to drug abuse?

# Development Environment

Language: python 3.8
Libraries Used: pandas, matplotlib

# Future Work

* Item 1: In the future, I will produce more visually aesthetic graphical analysis. 
* Item 2: I went into this project with the desire to use either KNN or Linear Regression to classify data, but this case didn't demand machine learning; just better basic analysis.
* Item 3: Jumping into coding is easy and often seems like the right course of action at the time, but thinking critically about questions, objectives, and timeframes produces a better workflow.
